            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This Website presents all relavent documents and information, in the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart security and safety system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system incorporates a PIR motion 	sensor and a smoke detector to enhance home security and safety. Through the Blynk application, users can remotely monitor and control the system, receiving real-time notifications of motion or smoke detection. This project demonstrates the effective integration of IoT technology into home automation, providing both convenience and improved security.</p>

            <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
            <p>The integration of smart devices into home security systems has been extensively studied and developed in recent years. According to Zhang et al. (2019), the use of IoT-based systems has significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of home security solutions. These systems leverage various sensors and communication protocols to provide real-time monitoring and control (Zhang et al., 2019).</p>
            <p>PIR sensors have been widely used for motion detection in security systems due to their reliability and low power consumption (Gopal & John, 2020). Similarly, smoke detectors are critical components in fire safety systems, providing early warnings to prevent potential disasters (Smith & Brown, 2018). The combination of these sensors with microcontrollers like the ESP32 enhances the overall functionality and user experience (Lee & Park, 2017).</p>
            <p>The Blynk platform has emerged as a popular choice for IoT projects due to its ease of use and robust features. Blynk allows for seamless integration of hardware with mobile applications, enabling users to receive notifications and control devices remotely (Johnson & Lee, 2021). This capability is particularly valuable in-home security systems where timely alerts and remote access are crucial.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project effectively integrates a PIR motion sensor and a smoke detector with an ESP32 microcontroller, resulting in a comprehensive home security and safety system. Using the Blynk app, users can receive real-time notifications and remotely control the system, improving convenience and security. One change from the initial proposal was made, namely using a fan instead of a buzzer, because the fan draws more power compared to the buzzer. The system's ability to operate offline ensures dependability in a variety of situations. Future enhancements will concentrate on increasing sensor capabilities, implementing AI-based analytics, and improving user interfaces to enhance the system's functionality and user experience.</p>
